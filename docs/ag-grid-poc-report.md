# AG Grid Community POC Report

This report documents how the React and Vue implementations using AG Grid Community fulfill the system requirements, highlights styling/theming, accessibility, performance/DX notes, and lists known limitations.

## Projects

- React: `react-app/` (`src/App.tsx`)
- Vue: `vue-app/` (`src/components/AgGridDemo.vue`, wired in `src/App.vue`)

## Requirement Coverage Matrix

Legend: ✅ Full, ⚠️ Partial/workaround, ❌ Not in Community

| Area | Requirement | React | Vue | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Basic Structure | General guide on usage | ✅ | ✅ | Toolbar: density selector (`rowHeight`) and toggles. |
|  | Define columns, headers, density | ✅ | ✅ | `columnDefs`, `headerName`, density → rowHeight mapping. |
|  | Visual indicators for data types | ✅ | ✅ | Sort/Filter indicators built-in; filter types per column (set/date/number). |
| Sorting & Pagination | Single/multi-column sorting | ✅ | ✅ | Multi-sort via Shift. |
|  | Visual sorting indicators | ✅ | ✅ | Built-in icons. |
|  | Pagination for large datasets | ✅ | ✅ | Page size selector: 10/20/50. |
| States & Loading | Empty states with messages | ✅ | ✅ | No-rows overlay when data empty or no match. |
|  | Loading states (skeleton/overlay) | ✅ | ✅ | Loading overlay with simulated delay. |
|  | Error messaging/retry | ✅ | ✅ | Error banner + dismiss; sets empty to show overlay. |
|  | Handle "no match" scenarios | ✅ | ✅ | React `onFilterChanged`, Vue `watch(rowData)`/overlay. |
| Filters & Search | Global/column filtering | ✅ | ✅ | Quick filter and per-column floating filters. |
|  | Filter by status/date/text | ✅ | ✅ | Set filter for status/role, date filter for createdAt, text for name/email. |
|  | Global search all columns | ✅ | ✅ | `quickFilterText`. |
|  | Scoped search per column | ✅ | ✅ | Column filter popovers + floating filters. |
| Row-level Actions | Inline actions (Edit/Delete) | ✅ | ✅ | React cellRenderer; Vue cellRenderer+onCellClicked. |
|  | Actions easily accessible | ✅ | ✅ | Buttons with labels. |
|  | Icons/buttons for clarity | ✅ | ✅ | Buttons present (icons can be added). |
| Grouping & Expansion | Grouped rows by category | ⚠️ | ⚠️ | Native grouping is Enterprise-only; can simulate via sort/formatting only. |
|  | Visual cues for expansion | ❌ | ❌ | Collapsible groups require Enterprise. |
|  | Collapsible groups | ❌ | ❌ | Enterprise-only. |
| A11y & Responsiveness | Keyboard navigation | ✅ | ✅ | Built-in; verified basic nav. |
|  | Screen reader/ARIA support | ✅ | ✅ | Built-in ARIA; can be extended. |
|  | Focus management | ✅ | ✅ | Managed by grid; focus rings present. |
|  | Responsive across devices | ✅ | ✅ | Theme responsive; horizontal scroll when needed. |
| Column Customization | Show/hide columns | ✅ | ✅ | Toolbar checkboxes toggle visibility via columnApi. |
|  | Persist user preferences | ✅ | ✅ | localStorage: column state (order/visibility). |
|  | Resize/reorder columns | ✅ | ✅ | Resizing enabled; reorder by drag (order saved). |
| Content Management | Content filtering rules | ✅ | ✅ | Filter types constrain data entry/search. |
|  | Text wrapping/ellipsis | ✅ | ✅ | Toggle wrapText/autoHeight; off shows ellipsis. |
| Navigation | Horizontal scrolling | ✅ | ✅ | When total width exceeds container. |
|  | Touch and mouse support | ✅ | ✅ | Built-in. |

## Theming & Styling

- Base theme: Quartz theme CSS is imported in both apps.
- Overrides: CSS variables demonstrate brand tweaks:
  - React: `react-app/src/App.css` under `.ag-theme-quartz`
  - Vue: `vue-app/src/assets/ag-theme-overrides.css` (imported in `src/main.ts`)
- You can move these variables into design tokens and apply via CSS variables at runtime for dark/light schemes.

## Accessibility Notes

- AG Grid provides keyboard navigation and ARIA attributes out of the box.
- Our action buttons include `aria-label`s; columns/filters announce state changes.
- Further audits (NVDA/VoiceOver) can be done if required; AG Grid docs include A11y guidance.

## Performance Considerations

- This POC uses the client-side row model with 50 rows. For large datasets, consider:
  - Server-Side Row Model (Enterprise) for virtualization across pagination
  - Infinite Row Model (Community) as an alternative
  - Column virtualization is built-in; cell renderers should be kept light.

## Developer Experience (DX)

- API is comprehensive and strongly typed.
- Documentation is extensive; examples available for most patterns.
- React and Vue bindings are consistent; concepts map 1:1 across frameworks.

## Limitations / Risks

- Row Grouping/Expansion and some advanced enterprise features are not available in Community:
  - Collapsible group rows
  - Pivoting, Aggregations, Server-Side Row Model
- If native grouping is a hard requirement, budget for AG Grid Enterprise or accept a simplified UX.

## Recommendation

- AG Grid Community meets the vast majority of the requirements out of the box in both React and Vue.
- If grouping/expansion must be first-class, evaluate AG Grid Enterprise; otherwise, AG Grid Community is a solid choice given functionality, docs, and ecosystem.

## How to Validate

1. Run React: `npm start --prefix react-app`
2. Run Vue: `npm install --prefix vue-app && npm run dev --prefix vue-app`
3. Use the toolbar to test:
   - Global search, density, wrap text
   - Column show/hide, save/restore state
   - Simulate loading and error; verify overlays
   - Multi-sort (hold Shift)
   - Row actions (Edit/Delete)
